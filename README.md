# Safari Theme for Firefox

This setup configures Firefox components to look more integrated and native on macOS or anywhere desired. It's made to work with the color themes below which let you switch between light and dark without editing CSS.

* [Safari Adaptive Light](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/safari-adapt-light/)

* [Safari Adaptive Dark](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/safari-adapt-dark/)
